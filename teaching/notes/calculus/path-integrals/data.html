Returning to the world of double integrals for a moment, the inner integral in</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center; line-height: 0"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="$$[NEWLINE][TAB]\int_a^b\!\!\!\int_c^d f(x, y)\,\text{d} x\,\text{d} y[NEWLINE]$$">$$\begin{align*}\int_a^b\!\!\!\int_c^d f(x, y)\,\text{d} x\,\text{d} y\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">was able to find the area under the graph of a cross-section of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="z = f(x, y)">$z = f(x, y)$;</span> specifically, the cross-section with <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$</span> held fixed and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> ranging from <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c">$c$</span> to <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="d">$d$.</span> But what if we wanted to find a different area, like that of a cross-section in a different direction?</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="pathIntegral" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">Having seen so many of the storylines of calculus at this point, we can reason through how this one might work: just like with directional derivatives, the fact that both <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$</span> are changing at once as we move along this curve means we can&#x2019;t get away with directly using single-variable calculus techniques like we could with partial derivatives or multiple integrals. Instead, we&#x2019;ll need to parameterize the curve in the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="xy">$xy$-plane</span> along which this travels in terms of a single parameter <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t">$t$</span> (like we did with directional derivatives), and then likely use a Riemann sum to slice up the curve into small changes in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t">$t$</span> (like we did with arc length).</p><p class="body-text">But hold on a minute! That blueprint that we just laid out would work for a lot more than just lines. We could parameterize <em>any</em> path in the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="xy">$xy$-plane</span> and then integrate over it! It&#x2019;s this idea that will really take off; let&#x2019;s look at one path in particular and then go find a formula.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="pathIntegral2" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">I highly recommend turning this graph around, then hiding the gray surface in the expressions list!
