In this final part, though, we&#x2019;ll be exploring functions that both take in <em>and</em> give out multiple numbers &mdash; functions <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n">$\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$</span> &mdash; and we&#x2019;ll find that this is a new and rather alien world. We&#x2019;ll see symbols we recognize and make use of calculus techniques we understand, and at times we&#x2019;ll crest hills and make remarkable connections that recontextualize things we learned long ago, but much of this journey will be into properly unexplored territory for us.</p><p class="body-text">Even the simplest example of a function <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{F} : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n">$\vec{F} : \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$</span> for <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="m = n = 2">$m = n = 2$</span> eludes traditional visualization: we can&#x2019;t plot 4 orthogonal axes of input and output, so we&#x2019;ll have to understand functions like this in a different way. However, we can leverage our terminology and understanding in part 5 to consider them as <em>vector-valued functions of multiple variables</em>.</p><p class="body-text">Let&#x2019;s begin by focusing on the function <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{F} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2">$\vec{F} : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$</span> given by</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center; line-height: 0"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="$$[NEWLINE][TAB]\vec{F}(x, y) = \left< x + 3y, 4x + 2y \right>.[NEWLINE]$$">$$\begin{align*}\vec{F}(x, y) = \left< x + 3y, 4x + 2y \right>.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">It takes in a point <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y)">$(x, y)$</span> and outputs a 2D vector, and we can plot that relationship by selecting some points in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^2">$\mathbb{R}^2$</span> and drawing the vector <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{F}(x, y)">$\vec{F}(x, y)$</span> (typically scaled down by a constant factor so all the vectors don&#x2019;t overlap too much) at each point <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y)">$(x, y)$.</span></p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="vectorField" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">We call this object, and by extension <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{F}">$\vec{F}$</span> itself, a <strong>vector field</strong>. We&#x2019;re drawing the vectors <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\vec{F}(x, y)">$\vec{F}(x, y)$</span> starting at their positions <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y)">$(x, y)$</span> out of necessity, since if we tried to put them all at the origin it would be an unreadable mess. But we don&#x2019;t need to let that get in the way of our understanding! This is just an opportunity to learn a useful lesson about math and science more broadly: when a new situation is confusing, lean into perspectives on it that you understand. Here, there&#x2019;s one context in particular where we&#x2019;ve been drawing vectors at positions not at the origin: derivatives of vector valued functions, and those that measure position in particular. Then the derivative is a velocity vector, and those naturally live <em>at</em> the position of the object whose velocity they&#x2019;re measuring.</p><p class="body-text">With this in mind, then, we can try to interpret this vector field as a collection of velocities. There&#x2019;s not just one curve of possible positions, though! An object could be <em>anywhere</em> in the field and still have a velocity assigned to it. A direct physical analogue is wind speed! In a flat open area, the wind velocity can vary between every possible position.</p><p class="body-text">Unfortunately, wind is famously not so easy to see. The way we typically <em>do</em> see wind is by its effects on other things that are easily moved by it, like leaves. Following that analogy, let&#x2019;s try visualizing a vector field as if it&#x2019;s giving us wind speed: we&#x2019;ll scatter a few thousand tiny particles in a 2D area and give them a velocity based on the vector field at their current position (so the velocity of each particle is constantly changing as it moves).</p><div class="desmos-border canvas-container"><canvas id="vectorField-canvas" class="output-canvas"></canvas></div><p class="body-text">This is an applet I made to visualize vector fields in exactly this way. A particle&#x2019;s color is based on its current direction (i.e. the angle of the vector field there), and its saturation is based on its velocity, so slow particles are paler. While drawing vector fields as grids of vectors is important for studying them precisely, I find these visualizations to be incredible useful for getting a general impression of a field. We&#x2019;ll also lean heavily on this interpretation in a few sections! I highly suggest visualizing vector fields like this whenever working with them; you can plot any fields you like with the applet itself.</p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;"><div class="image-links"><a href="/applets/vector-fields" class="image-link"><img src="/graphics/general-icons/placeholder.png" data-src="/applets/vector-fields/cover.webp" alt="Vector Fields" tabindex="1"></img><p class="image-link-subtext">Vector Fields</p></a></div></div><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><div class="notes-exc-title notes-title">Exercise: sketching vector fields</div><p class="body-text numbered-list-item">1.

Each partial integral produced a function satisfying one of the derivative conditions but not the other, so at each crossing, one of the two components of the field will match the gradient. For example, with <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="h(x, y) = xy">$h(x, y) = xy$,</span> the level curve <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c = 1">$c = 1$</span> is the curve <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y = \frac{1}{x}">$y = \frac{1}{x}$.</span> At the point <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(1, 1)">$(1, 1)$,</span> the gradient is <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\left< 1, 1 \right>">$\left< 1, 1 \right>$,</span> drawn as the upper-right vector, and we can see that although the flow doesn&#x2019;t follow that vector, the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$-component</span> still matches. That&#x2019;s true for any half-correct potential function we produce in this way, but what&#x2019;s unusual about this one is how the other candidate for a potential function that we produced was <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="h(x, y) = -xy">$h(x, y) = -xy$,</span> whose level curves coincide with the other possible value of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="h">$h$.</span> The <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c = -1">$c = -1$</span> level curve of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="h(x, y) = -xy">$h(x, y) = -xy$</span> is once again <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y = \frac{1}{x}">$y = \frac{1}{x}$,</span> but this time, the gradient is <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\left< -1, -1 \right>">$\left< -1, -1 \right>$</span> (the other white vector). Sure enough, the <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$-component</span> of the field matches there, but not <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="y">$y$.</span></p></div><div class="text-buttons nav-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button nav-button previous-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Previous</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button nav-button home-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Home</button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button linked-text-button nav-button next-nav-button" type="button" tabindex="-1">Next</button></div></div></section></main>
