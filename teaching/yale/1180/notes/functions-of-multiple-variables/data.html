In single-variable calculus, <strong>interval notation</strong> largely suffices to describe the sets of real numbers we need to deal with: for example, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="[-1, 3)">$[-1, 3)$</span> is the set of all numbers <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> such that <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="-1 \leq x < 3">$-1 \leq x < 3$.</span> We also sometimes use the union symbol <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\cup">$\cup$</span> to &#x201C;add&#x201D; two sets together, as in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(-\infty, -5] \cup [5, \infty)">$(-\infty, -5] \cup [5, \infty)$</span> for the set of real numbers <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x">$x$</span> with <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="|x| \geq 5">$|x| \geq 5$.</span> When we&#x2019;re working with sets in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^2">$\mathbb{R}^2$</span> and higher, though, intervals aren&#x2019;t quite enough to describe all of the sets we&#x2019;re interested in. When we find ourselves describing the unit sphere as &#x201C;the set of points <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y, z)">$(x, y, z)$</span> in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^3">$\mathbb{R}^3$</span> with <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1">$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$&#x201D;,</span> we&#x2019;re pushing up against the limitations of how long a sentence can be before it&#x2019;s too clunky to use. To reduce some of that pressure, we&#x2019;ll introduce a notation for turning a long sentence like that into a more dense but more routinely parsable sequence of symbols.</p><p class="body-text">Rather than give a formal definition, we&#x2019;ll introduce set builder notation by way of example.

Set builder notation uses braces, as do sets when they&#x2019;re presented as lists of numbers, like <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\left\{ 1, 2, 3 \right\}">$\left\{ 1, 2, 3 \right\}$</span> for the set containing <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$,</span> <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="2">$2$,</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="3">$3$.</span> Within those braces, every set builder expression has a left part and a right part, separated by the vertical bar <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mid">$\mid$,</span> which we read as &#x201C;such that&#x201D;.</p><p class="body-text">On the left, we write the general form an element from the set takes (i.e <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y, z)">$(x, y, z)$),</span> and where it lives. The symbol <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\in">$\in$</span> means &#x201C;element of&#x201D;, and we usually just read it as &#x201C;in&#x201D;. All in all, <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3">$(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3$</span> means &#x201C;all points <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(x, y, z)">$(x, y, z)$</span> in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\mathbb{R}^3">$\mathbb{R}^3$&#x201D;.</span> To the right of the separator bar, we list conditions that the points have to satisfy to be in the set.

The 3D view lets us check that this is correct &mdash; try <span class="click-tap"><span>clicking</span><span>tapping</span></span> the 2D graph paper icon in the top right &mdash; but it&#x2019;s valuable to be able to intuit facts about a graph from the level curves alone. For example, we can see that the graph is circular when sliced in this manner, and that it&#x2019;s steepest far away from the origin.</p><div class="notes-exc notes-environment"><div class="notes-exc-title notes-title">Exercise: level curves</div><p class="body-text">This Desmos graph shows the level curves of a function for various values of <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="c">$c$.</span> What can you say about the function?
