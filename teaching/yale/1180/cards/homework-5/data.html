You should show enough work that there is no question about the mathematical process used to obtain your answers, and so that your peers in the class could easily follow along. I encourage you to collaborate with your classmates, so long as you write up your solutions independently. If you collaborate with any classmates, please include a statement on your assignment acknowledging with whom you collaborated.</p><div class="text-buttons"><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button" type="button" id="download-homework-5-pdf-button" tabindex="-1"></button></div><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button" type="button" id="download-homework-5-tex-button" tabindex="-1"></button></div></div><p class="body-text"><span style="height: 32px"></span></p><p class="body-text">In problems 1&ndash;4, find and classify the critical points of the function <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f">$f$</span> as local minima, local maxima, or saddle points.</p><p class="body-text numbered-list-item">1. <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(x, y) = x^3y + 27x^2 - 27y">$f(x, y) = x^3y + 27x^2 - 27y$.</span></p><p class="body-text numbered-list-item">2. <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - \frac{1}{xy}">$f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - \frac{1}{xy}$.</span></p><p class="body-text numbered-list-item">3. <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(x, y) = -x^4 + e^{-y^{2}}">$f(x, y) = -x^4 + e^{-y^{2}}$.</span></p><p class="body-text numbered-list-item">4. <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(x, y, z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}">$f(x, y, z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$.</span></p><p class="body-text"><span style="height: 32px"></span></p><p class="body-text numbered-list-item">5.
