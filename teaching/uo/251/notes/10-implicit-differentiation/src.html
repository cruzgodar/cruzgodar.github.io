!begin-text-block
	
	We typically define functions <dfn>explicitly</dfn>. All that means is that $y$ is written as a function of $x$, so that we have an equation of the form $y = f(x)$. The plot of this function is all of the $(x, y)$-pairs that satisfy the equation, and since $y$ is on its own, we can just plug in a bunch of $x$-values to $f$ and get the $y$-values directly.
	
	It&#x2019;s possible to write down functions without forcing $y$ to be alone on one side, though. For example, the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ defines a curve: its points are given by all the $x$ and $y$ with $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Now it&#x2019;s not possible to solve for $y$ explicitly this way, since we&#x2019;d have to take a square root, which results in $y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}$. Visually, this means the curve doesn&#x2019;t pass the vertical line test, which means it&#x2019;s not a function.

	We can still talk about slopes of tangent lines, though. Pictured above is a graph of $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, along with two different tangent lines that share the same $x$-value. When a curve is defined with the $x$ and $y$ intermixed and not in the form $y = f(x)$, we say the curve is defined <dfn>implicitly</dfn>, and the process of finding the slopes of tangent lines is called <dfn>implicit differentiation</dfn>.
	
	The process takes a second to get used to, because it typically involves heavy use of the Chain Rule in situations where it might not seem to apply at first glance.

!begin-thm
	
	implicit differentiation
	
	To find the derivative of a function defined implicitly in terms of $x$ and $y$:
	
	1. Take $\frac{d}{dx}$ of both sides. While derivatives of $x$ work normally, $y$ is a function of $x$, so it&#x2019;s necessary to use the Chain Rule. We have $\frac{d}{dx}[y] = \frac{dy}{dx}$, so for example, $\frac{d}{dx}[\tan(y)] = \sec^2(y) \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$.
	
	2. Move all terms containing $\frac{dy}{dx}$ to one side of the equation and all the other terms to the other side.
	
	3. Factor out $\frac{dy}{dx}$ and divide by whatever is left over.
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	implicit differentiation
	
	The curve $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ has two points with $x = \frac{1}{2}$. Find the slopes of the tangent lines for each point.
	
	First, let&#x2019;s find $\frac{dy}{dx}$. We do this by differentiating both sides $dx$.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			x^2 + y^2 &= 1\\
			\frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + y^2] &= \frac{d}{dx}[1]\\
			\frac{d}{dx}[x^2] + \frac{d}{dx}[y^2] &= 0\\
			2x + 2y\frac{dy}{dx} &= 0\\
			2y\frac{dy}{dx} &= -2x\\
			\frac{dy}{dx} &= -\frac{x}{y}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Notice how the derivative is in terms of both $x$ and $y$. It&#x2019;s not enough to specify $x$, because this isn&#x2019;t necessarily a function, so there can be multiple points with the same $x$-value. For our purposes, we need to find the points with $x$-coordinate $\frac{1}{2}$, so we solve $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 = 1$. That gives $y^2 = \frac{3}{4}$, and so $y = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at the top point is
	
	$$
		\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1/2}{\sqrt{3}/2} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
	$$
	
	Similarly, the slope at the bottom point is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. This looks about right given the previous picture.

	Find $\frac{dy}{dx}$. Looking at the graph, the tangent line seems poorly defined when $x$ is a multiple of $2\pi$ and $y$ is a multiple of $\pi$. Explain what&#x2019;s going on using the equation.

	!desmos sin-thing
	
	We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			x\sin(xy) &= y\\
			\frac{d}{dx}[x\sin(xy)] &= \frac{d}{dx}[y]\\
			\frac{d}{dx}[x] \cdot \sin(xy) + x \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[\sin(xy)] &= \frac{dy}{dx}\\
			\sin(xy) + x \cos(xy) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[xy] &= \frac{dy}{dx}\\
			\sin(xy) + x \cos(xy) \left(\frac{d}{dx}[x] \cdot y + x \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[y]\right) &= \frac{dy}{dx}\\
			\sin(xy) + x \cos(xy) \left(y + x \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}\right) &= \frac{dy}{dx}\\
			\sin(xy) + xy \cos(xy) + x^2\cos(xy) \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{dy}{dx}\\
			(x^2\cos(xy) - 1) \frac{dy}{dx} &= -\sin(xy) - xy \cos(xy)\\
			\frac{dy}{dx} &= \frac{-\sin(xy) - xy \cos(xy)}{x^2\cos(xy) - 1}.
		\end{align*}

!text s Logarithmic Differentiation

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	Implicit differentiation unlocks one extra technique: sometimes, difficult functions to differentiate become much easier when we take a log on both sides. Specifically, functions involving strange exponents will turn into multiplication, so we can use the product rule. So: if you have a function of the form $y = (f(x))^{g(x)}$, start by rewriting it as
	
	$$
		\ln(y) = \ln((f(x))^{g(x)}) = g(x)\ln(f(x)),
	$$
	
	and then differentiate implicitly.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-example
	
	logarithmic differentiation
	
	Find $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[x^x]$.
	
	Since $x$ is in both the base and the exponent, we can&#x2019;t use either the derivative rules for $x^b$ or $b^x$. Instead, we write
	
	$$
		\ln(y) = \ln(x^x) = x\ln(x),
	$$
	
	and then differentiate implicitly to get
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} &= \ln(x) + x \cdot \frac{1}{x}\\
			\frac{dy}{dx} &= y(\ln(x) + 1)\\
			\frac{dy}{dx} &= x^x(\ln(x) + 1).
		\end{align*}
	$$

	At long last, we can handle the derivative of $x^n$, where $n$ is not just a rational number, but <strong>any real number</strong>. Thankfully, it&#x2019;s exactly what we&#x2019;d like it to be.

	the derivative of $x^n$ for any real $n$	
	
	Let $n$ be a real number. Then $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$.
	
!end-thm

!begin-proof
	
	With $y = x^n$, write
	
	$$
		\ln(y) = \ln(x^n) = n\ln(x).
	$$
	
	Then
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{y} \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{n}{x},
	$$
	
	so
	
	$$
		\frac{dy}{dx} = y\frac{n}{x} = \frac{nx^n}{x} = nx^{n-1}.
	$$
