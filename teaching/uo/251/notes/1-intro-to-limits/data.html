You can evaluate a function at a number, or solve for when a function is zero, or create a function to model a certain quantity. The more we use functions, though, the more certain limitations become clear. For example, if we have a function <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="s(t)">$s(t)$</span> that measures your position after <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t">$t$</span> seconds, then how do we determine your velocity <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="v(t)">$v(t)$?</span> Knowing exactly where you are at all times <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t">$t$,</span> we really ought to be able to tell how fast you&#x2019;re moving, but we don&#x2019;t have the tools to do that yet.</p><p class="body-text">If you&#x2019;re moving at a constant rate &mdash; say 2 meters per second (written <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\frac{m}{s}">$\frac{m}{s}$),</span> then your position function <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="s(t)">$s(t)$,</span> which just measures total distance from where you started, is a straight line with slope 2.</p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="velocity-example" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">The slope of a line is informally its rise over its run, and if the run is <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$,</span> that means the slope is how much the output changes when the input increases by 1. For our position example, that&#x2019;s literally meters moved per second, which is velocity. That rise over run definition means that if we want to figure out the rate of change of a function, we should look at slopes of lines. Let&#x2019;s see how well this idea works in practice with the function <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(t) = t^2">$f(t) = t^2$</span> &mdash; starting from <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 0">$t = 0$,</span> we&#x2019;ll divide rise by run, where run is exactly <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$.</span></p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="secant-lines" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">If it seems strange to talk about the slope of something that&#x2019;s not a curve, you might find it easier to think about the blue line: if we draw it to pass through the two points we&#x2019;re looking at on the red curve, then its slope is the rise over run between those two points, which is the same quantity we&#x2019;re thinking about. Since one point is at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 0">$t = 0$</span> and the other is at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 1">$t = 1$,</span> the run is <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$,</span> and the rise is also <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1">$1$,</span> since <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(0) = 0^2 = 0">$f(0) = 0^2 = 0$</span> and <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(1) = 1^2 = 1">$f(1) = 1^2 = 1$.</span> Therefore, the slope of that blue line is <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\frac{1}{1} = 1">$\frac{1}{1} = 1$.</span></p><p class="body-text">Imagine that <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f">$f$</span> is measuring the distance you&#x2019;ve traveled after <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t">$t$</span> seconds. You start off barely moving at all, and only really pick up speed down the line. You definitely don&#x2019;t have velocity <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="1 \frac{m}{s}">$1 \frac{m}{s}$</span> from the moment you start, or the graph wouldn&#x2019;t have such a slow start from the origin. So what&#x2019;s the problem with the slope we found?</p><p class="body-text">Fundamentally, your velocity at time <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 0">$t = 0$</span> shouldn&#x2019;t have anything to do with your position at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 1">$t = 1$.</span> You might speed up or slow down a lot in that intervening second &mdash; maybe you even walk backward! In our case, we sped up a lot, since our position is increasing faster at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 1">$t = 1$</span> than <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 0">$t = 0$.</span> In order to take a better measurement, we can make the run smaller in our slope calculation: for example, if we take <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = .1">$t = .1$,</span> only a tenth of a second after we start measuring, then there&#x2019;s much less time for changes in position to affect the rise of the line. As a result, we get a better approximation of the actual velocity at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 0">$t = 0$.</span> Set <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="b = .1">$b = .1$</span> in the graph above to see the slope we&#x2019;re measuring.</p><p class="body-text">What&#x2019;s the slope now? The rise over run calculation gives us</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="$$[NEWLINE][TAB]\frac{f(.1) - f(0)}{.1 - 0} = \frac{.1^2}{.1} = .1.[NEWLINE]$$">$$\begin{align*}\frac{f(.1) - f(0)}{.1 - 0} = \frac{.1^2}{.1} = .1.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">Better! Since our approximations improve as we have a smaller and smaller run, the best approximation &mdash; in fact, the actual velocity we&#x2019;re after &mdash; is the slope of a line with <strong>no</strong> run at all. Let&#x2019;s define a couple terms to make talking about these things easier.</p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><div class="notes-def-title notes-title">Definition: secant and tangent lines</div><p class="body-text">A <strong>secant line</strong> through a curve is a line that passes through two particular points on the curve. A <strong>tangent line</strong> is formed from a secant line by sliding one point until it is in the same location as the other.</p></div><p class="body-text">So far, we&#x2019;ve been dealing with secant lines, but what we want is a tangent line, which appears when both points are at <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(0, 0)">$(0, 0)$.</span></p><div class="desmos-border"><div id="tangent-lines" class="desmos-container"></div></div><p class="body-text">As you might be able to predict, that line is totally flat! So our velocity at time <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="t = 0">$t = 0$</span> is zero, because although we pick up speed later, we don&#x2019;t have any right at the start. If this seems strange, think of dropping a ball above the ground: gravity speeds it up over time, but at the exact moment you let go, it has zero velocity.</p><p class="body-text">It might not seem like it, but we actually just did something profound: we defined the slope of something that&#x2019;s not a line.</p><div class="notes-def notes-environment"><div class="notes-def-title notes-title">Definition: slope of a curve</div><p class="body-text">Let <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="f(x)">$f(x)$</span> be a function.

We already have a formula for the slope of a secant line, so let&#x2019;s just plug in the same point twice to find the slope of a tangent line. So in the example we&#x2019;ve been talking about, that means plugging in <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="(0, 0)">$(0, 0)$</span> for both the left and right points:</p><p class="body-text" style="text-align: center"><span class="tex-holder" style="padding: 8px" data-source-tex="$$[NEWLINE][TAB]\frac{f(0) - f(0)}{0 - 0} = \frac{0}{0}.[NEWLINE]$$">$$\begin{align*}\frac{f(0) - f(0)}{0 - 0} = \frac{0}{0}.\end{align*}$$</span></p><p class="body-text">And now it all comes grinding to a halt. We can&#x2019;t divide anything by zero &mdash; even dividing zero by itself is a problem. No matter what slope we try to calculate, we&#x2019;ll have this problem, since the rise over run formula will always be <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="\frac{0}{0}">$\frac{0}{0}$.</span> So what can we do? That line <strong>has</strong> a slope &mdash; the problem isn&#x2019;t that it&#x2019;s not well-defined or something similar, it&#x2019;s just that we cannot calculate it with methods in math that we&#x2019;ve learned so far.</p><p class="body-text">It&#x2019;s important that we spell out the problem we&#x2019;re running into clearly.
