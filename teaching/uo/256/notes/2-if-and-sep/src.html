With the initial definitions out of the way, let's get started actually solving some DEs. We'll stick to first-order ones for the next few sections, which means the only derivative in the equation will be $y'$. If we also narrow our attention exclusively to linear DEs, the problems become simple enough that we can develop a general solving method.



## Integrating Factors

At first glance, our first solving method can seem like some sort of black magic: we'll take a first-order linear DE, multiply both sides by something seemingly random, and then the equation will collapse into something much simpler. Let's first see it in action in an example, and then we'll dig into the specifics.



### ex an integrating factor
	
	Solve $y' + ty = t$, given $y(0) = 3$.
	
	It's worth pointing out why we can't just solve this directly: to get rid of the derivative on $y$, we'd like to integrate, but we have to integrate $dt$, and solving for $y'$ puts it in terms of $t$ *and* $y$, ruining our chances of integrating. Instead, let's take the (bizarre) step of multiplying both sides by $e^{t^2 / 2}$, which gives us
	
	$$
		e^{t^2 / 2}y' + te^{t^2 / 2}y = te^{t^2 / 2}.
	$$
	
	Now let's take a close look at the left side of the equation. The derivative of $e^{t^2 / 2}$ is
	
	$$
		\frac{d}{dt} \left[ e^{t^2 / 2} \right] = te^{t^2 / 2},
	$$
	
	so if we define a function $\mu$ (a Greek letter pronounced "myu") by $\mu(t) = e^{t^2 / 2}$, then we can rewrite the DE as
	
	$$
		\mu(t)y'(t) + \mu'(t)y(t) = t\mu(t).
	$$
	
	It's true that the right side is also equal to $\mu'(t)$, but since that won't end up being the case in general, we'll leave it as $t\mu(t)$ here. Now it's time for a step seemingly out of nowhere: the left side of the DE looks like a derivative that came from the product rule! Specifically, we can rewrite it as
	
	$$
		\frac{d}{dt} \left[ \mu(t)y(t) \right] = t\mu(t),
	$$
	
	and since everything is now a function of $t$, we can integrate both sides $dt$ to get
	
	$$
		\mu(t)y(t) &= \int t\mu(t)\,dt
		
		&= \int te^{t^2 / 2}\,dt.
	$$
	
	With $u = \frac{t^2}{2}$ and $du = t\,dt$, we have
	
	$$
		\mu(t)y(t) &= \int e^u\,du
		
		&= e^u + c
		
		&= e^{t^2 / 2} + c.
	$$
	
	To solve for $y$, we just need to divide both sides by $\mu(t) = e^{t^2 / 2}$, so in total, the result is
	
	$$
		y &= \frac{e^{t^2 / 2}}{e^{t^2 / 2}} + \frac{c}{e^{t^2 / 2}}
		
		&= 1 + ce^{-t^2 / 2}.
	$$
	
	This is the general solution, since we can choose any value for $c$. To solve for the particular solution we're looking for, we plug in $t = 0$ and $y = 3$:
	
	$$
		3 &= 1 + ce^{-0^2 / 2} = 1 + c
		
		2 &= c.
	$$
	
	In total, our solution is
	
	$$
		y &= 1 + 2e^{-t^2 / 2}.
	$$
	
###



This was a really slick way to solve the problem, but it couldn't be less general. If this is going to help us solve more DEs than this specific one, we need to know exactly how to find the particular value of $\mu(t)$ that makes the left side of the equation collapse with the product rule. First of all, we need $y$ and $y'$ to be separate for the product rule to work, and there can't be any higher derivatives. That's exactly what it means to be a first-order linear DE, and the general form of one of those is

$$
	y' + p(t)y = q(t).
$$

Here, we've divided by whatever factor used to be on $y'$. Now if we multiply both sides by some function $\mu(t)$ (that we don't know yet), we get

$$
	\mu(t)y' + \mu(t)p(t)y = \mu(t)q(t).
$$

For the left side to collapse with the product rule, we need the coefficient of $y$ to be equal to $\mu'(t)$: specifically,

$$
	\mu'(t) &= \mu(t)p(t)
	\frac{1}{\mu(t)} \mu'(t) &= p(t).
$$

This looks a little like alphabet soup, but we're actually almost done. If we integrate both sides $dt$, we have

$$
	\int \frac{1}{\mu(t)} \mu'(t)\,dt = \int p(t)\,dt,
$$

and if we take $u = \mu(t)$, then $du = \mu'(t)\,dt$, so

$$
	\int \frac{1}{u}\,du &= \int p(t)\,dt
	
	\log |u| + C &= \int p(t)\,dt
	
	\log |u| &= \int p(t)\,dt - C
	
	|u| &= e^{\int p(t)\,dt - C}.
$$

Since any value of $C$ will work here, let's just take $C = 0$. We can also drop the absolute value, since any power of $e$ will always be positive. And $u = \mu(t)$, so in total,

$$
	\mu(t) = e^{\int p(t)\,dt}.
$$

Since it's a little awkward to write big expressions like integrals inside an exponent, we often write this as

$$
	\mu(t) = \exp \left( \int p(t)\,dt \right),
$$

where $\exp(x)$ just means $e^x$.

This is a pretty great first step for the class --- we now have a method to solve any first-order linear DE, as long as we can evaluate the necessary integrals! Since $\mu(t)$ is a factor multiplying every term and both finding it and using involve integrating, we call $\mu(t)$ an **integrating factor**. Let's write down the general method and then work through some examples.



### thm !Method: integrating factors
	
	To solve a first-order linear DE:
	
	1. Rewrite the equation as $y' + p(t)y = q(t)$.
	
	2. Set $\mu(t) = \exp \left( \int p(t)\,dt \right)$ and evaluate the integral to find $\mu$. Since any value of $C$ works, just pick a convenient one (usually $C = 0$).
	
	3. Multiply both sides of the DE by $\mu(t)$. The left side should now collapse from the product rule, resulting in $\frac{d}{dt} [\mu(t) y] = \mu(t)q(t)$.
	
	4. Integrate both sides and solve for $y$. If it's possible, evaluate the integral --- if not, then express it as a definite integral with an upper limit or $t$ in order to make initial value problems work correctly. With this integral, make sure *not* to drop the $+c$, since it's part of the solution.
	
###



### ex integrating factors
	
	Solve the DE $$ty' + 2y = t^2$$, given $$y(2) = 2$$.
	
	This DE is first-order and linear, so we can use integrating factors. First, we need to make sure there's no coefficient on $y'$, so we divide both sides by $t$:
	
	$$
		y' + \frac{2}{t} y = t.
	$$
	
	Now our integrating factor is
	
	$$
		\mu(t) &= \exp \left( \int \frac{2}{t}\,dt \right)
		
		&= \exp \left( 2\log|t| \right)
		
		&= t^2.
	$$
	
	Be careful with canceling exponentials and logarithms! Here, we either need to move the 2 into the $\log$ as a power on $t$ or use the fact that multiplication of exponents is successive exponentiation before we can cancel.
	
	Now we can multiply both sides by $\mu$ and collapse the left side.
	
	$$
		t^2y' + 2ty &= t^3
		
		\frac{d}{dt} \left[ t^2y \right] &= t^3
		
		t^2 y &= \int t^3\,dt
		
		t^2 y &= \frac{t^4}{4} + c
		
		y &= \frac{t^2}{4} + \frac{c}{t^2}.
	$$
	
	The final step is to plug in the initial value $y(2) = 2$, which gives us
	
	$$
		2 &= \frac{4}{4} + \frac{c}{4}
		
		c = 4.
	$$
	
	So in total, the solution is
	
	$$
		y = \frac{t^2}{4} + \frac{4}{t^2}.
	$$

### exc integrating factors
	
	A colony of ants have made the unfortunate decision to build their nest out of uranium. As they scale up construction, the colony radioactively decays faster, and the mass $M(t)$ of the structure satisfies the DE
	
	$$
		M'(t) = t - M(t),
	$$
	
	where $t$ is measured in days and $M(t)$ in grams. If the colony begins at $100$ grams, what will the mass be after a week?
	
###



We have to be able to integrate $p(t)$ to find $\mu(t)$, but we won't always be able to evaluate the second integral to finish solving for $y$. In that case, we need to be a little more careful with how we write the solution --- let's take a look at an example.



### ex a complicating factor
	
	Solve the initial value problem $$y' + ty = 1$$, given $$y(1) = 1$$.
	
	As usual, we'll solve for $\mu$:
	
	$$
		\mu(t) &= \exp \left(\int t\,dt\right)
		
		&= e^{t^2 / 2}.
	$$
	
	The DE then becomes
	
	$$
		e^{t^2 / 2}y' + te^{t^2 / 2}y &= e^{t^2 / 2}
		
		\frac{d}{dt} \left[ e^{t^2 / 2}y \right] &= e^{t^2 / 2}
		
		e^{t^2 / 2}y &= \int e^{t^2 / 2}\,dt
		
		y &= e^{-t^2 / 2}\int e^{t^2 / 2}\,dt.
	$$
	
	Unfortunately, we're at the end of the road with that integral. $e^{t^2}$ is famously not an integrable function --- there is no combination of power functions, exponential functions, logarithms, and trig functions whose derivative is $e^{t^2}$. In and of itself that's not a huge problem --- we can just leave $y$ expressed in terms of this integral --- but there's a subtlety with the initial value. While it looks like plugging in $1$ for $t$ should mean replacing every value of $t$ with $1$, the $t$s inside the integral can't be treated the same way, since they're being integrated away. It's the same reason we can't plug in values before differentiating. For example, if $f(t) = 2t$ and $F(t) = \int f(t)\,dt$, then we have
	
	$$
		F(5) &= 5^2 = 25
		\int 2 \cdot 5\,dt &= 10t + C,
	$$
	
	which are so different from one another that one is a number and the other is a function. The easiest way to actually plug in a value to a function inside an integral is to rewrite it using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus --- not part II, which is the version expressing definite integrals in terms of antiderivatives that we use all the time, but the less-often-remembered part I, which states that
	
	$$
		\int f(t)\,dt = \int_a^t f(s)\,ds + C
	$$
	
	for any value of $a$ (since differentiating both sides will make it vanish). The advantage of this form is that it properly scopes the $t$ without requiring us to actually integrate: we can correctly plug in values for $t$ now. In our example, we have
	
	$$
		y = e^{-t^2 / 2} \left( \int_a^t e^{s^2 / 2}\,ds + c \right).
	$$
	
	We can choose any value for $a$, but there is one choice that's significantly better than any other: since we're about to set $t = 1$ to solve the initial value problem, we should take $a = 1$ so that the integral will disappear. With $y(1) = 1$,
	
	$$
		1 &= e^{-1^2 / 2} \left( \int_1^1 e^{s^2 / 2}\,ds + c \right)
		
		1 &= e^{-\frac{1}{2}} \left( 0 + c \right)
		
		c &= e^{\frac{1}{2}}.
	$$
	
	After a little rearranging, our solution becomes
	
	$$
		y = e^{\frac{1 - t^2}{2}} + e^{-t^2 / 2} \int_1^t e^{s^2 / 2}\,ds.
	$$

## Separation of Variables

Our next technique involves quite a bit less sleight of hand --- rather than introducing a mysterious new factor like $\mu$, we'll just be solving equations directly. As before, let's open with an example, and then we'll write down the general method.



### ex separation of variables
	
	Solve $$y' - \frac{2t + \sin(t)}{y^2} = 0$$, given $y(0) = 0$.
	
	To get started, we'll isolate $y'$:
	
	$$
		y' = \frac{2t + \sin(t)}{y^2}.
	$$
	
	Now we can write $y'$ as $\frac{dy}{dt}$ and take the somewhat unsettling step of multiplying both sides by $dt$, followed by $y^2$.
	
	$$
		\frac{dy}{dt} &= \frac{2t + \sin(t)}{y^2}
		
		dy &= \frac{2t + \sin(t)}{y^2}\,dt
		
		y^2\,dy &= (2t + \sin(t))\,dt.
	$$
	
	Both sides look like integrals without the integral symbol, and that's exactly what they are! Let's write it in and then integrate.
	
	$$
		\int y^2\,dy &= \int (2t + \sin(t))\,dt
		
		\frac{y^3}{3} &= t^2 - \cos(t) + c
	$$
	
	Since we have integrals on both sides, we only need one $+c$. Now we'll solve for $y$:
	
	$$
		y = \sqrt[3]{3t^2 - 3\cos(t) + 3c}.
	$$
	
	And just like that, we've found our general solution! Plugging in $y(0) = 0$ gives us
	
	$$
		0 &= \sqrt[3]{3(0) - 3(1) + 3c}
		
		0 &= \sqrt[3]{3c - 3}
		
		0 &= 3c - 3
		
		c &= 1.
	$$
	
	Our final answer is
	
	$$
		y = \sqrt[3]{3t^2 - 3\cos(t) + 3}.
	$$
	
###



There's not much difference between this example and the general process for separation of variables --- just separate the variables to opposite sides of the equals sign, integrate, and solve. For this to work, we can only have $y'$ in the DE, so it needs to be first-order, and critically, we have to be able to actually *do* the separation step.



### def separable differential equation
	
	A DE is **separable** if it can be written in the form $y' = f(y)g(t)$ for some $f$ and $g$.
	
###



In other words, we need to be able to write $y'$ as a product of only $y$-stuff with only $t$-stuff.



### thm !Method: Separation of Variables
	
	To solve a separable DE $y' = f(y)g(t)$:
	
	1. Rewrite $y'$ as $\frac{dy}{dt}$ and get all the $y$s on the left and $t$s on the right:
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{f(y)}\,dy = g(t)\,dt.
	$$
	
	2. Integrate both sides and solve for $y$.
	
	3. Also solve $f(y) = 0$ for equilibrium solutions, since we had to assume $f(y) \neq 0$ to complete step 1.
	
###



Not so bad! Let's work through another example.



### ex separation of variables
	
	Solve $$y' = \frac{x^2}{e^y(x^2 + 4)}$$, given that $y(0) = 0$.
	
	This DE is more or less already separated as is. Moving the $y$s to the left and the $x$s to the right gives us
	
	$$
		e^y\,dy &= \frac{x^2}{x^2 + 4}\,dx
		
		\int e^y\,dy &= \int \frac{x^2}{x^2 + 4}\,dx
	$$
	
	The $y$ integral is simple enough, but the one on the right is a trig sub problem! Let's go through it --- it's a good chance for review. The denominator is of the form $x^2 + a^2$ with $a = 2$, so we'll substitute $x = 2\tan(\theta)$. Then $dx = 2\sec^2(\theta)\,d\theta$, and so we have
	
	$$
		e^y &= \int \frac{8\tan^2(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{4\left(\tan^2(\theta) + 1\right)}\,d\theta
		
		e^y &= \int \frac{2\tan^2(\theta)\sec^2(\theta)}{\sec^2(\theta)}\,d\theta
		
		e^y &= \int 2\tan^2(\theta)\,d\theta
		
		e^y &= 2\int \left( \sec^2(\theta) - 1 \right) \,d\theta
		
		e^y &= 2 \left( \tan(\theta) - \theta + c\right)
		
		e^y &= 2 \tan(\theta) - 2\theta + 2c
		
		e^y &= 2 \left( \frac{x}{2} \right) - 2\arctan\left( \frac{x}{2} \right) + 2c
		
		y &= \log \left( x - 2\arctan\left( \frac{x}{2} \right) + 2c \right).
	$$
	
	In the language of the previous method, we had to divide both sides by $\frac{1}{e^y}$, which is never zero, so there are no equilibrium solutions to solve for. Plugging in our initial condition results in
	
	$$
		0 &= \log \left( 0 - 2\arctan\left( 0 \right) + 2c \right)
		
		0 &= \log \left( 2c \right)
		
		e^0 &= 2c
		
		c &= \frac{1}{2},
	$$
	
	so our solution is
	
	$$
		y = \log \left( x - 2\arctan\left( \frac{x}{2} \right) + 1 \right).
	$$

## Tank Problems

With a few solving techniques in the toolbelt, we're ready to look at applications of first-order DEs. There are dozens upon hundreds of these --- any situation where it's easier to find a formula for the rate of change of a quantity than a formula for the quantity itself is a candidate --- but we'll stick to one of the classics for now.

Unlike the tank problems from calculus II that involve finding the work done by pumping all of the liquid out of a tank, our tank problems will see the volume remain constant. What we're concerned with instead is the analyzing the mixing of two substances and determining the concentration over time. Let's get straight into an example.



### ex a mixing problem
	
	A $1000$ liter tank of water contains $20\,\text{kg}$ of salt dissolved in it. We begin pouring in a brine solution with a salt concentration of $0.1\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}}$ at a rate of $2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$. At the same time, we begin draining well-mixed solution from the bottom of the tank at the same rate of $2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$. After $30$ minutes, what will the mass of salt in the tank be? What will the long-term mass approach?
	
	There's a lot to digest here! It's always a good idea to name some variables so we can start building equations --- to that end, let's let $Q(t)$ be the mass of salt in the tank after $t$ minutes. Since the only information we're given refers to the way in which $Q$ changes, we'll want to find $Q$ in a DE first, then solve that to get an explicit formula.
	
	So --- what's the rate of change of the mass of salt in the tank? It's just the amount coming in minus the amount going out, and neither is terribly hard to find. Since mass is equal to density times volume, the mass per minute entering the tank is
	
	$$
		\left( 0.1\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}} \right) \left( 2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}} \right) = 0.2\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{min}}.
	$$
	
	The mass of salt leaving the tank per minute at time $t$ is a little more complicated. The formula looks similar to the previous one, but since the tank is well-mixed, the density involves $Q$ itself:
	
	$$
		\left( \frac{Q}{1000}\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}} \right) \left( 2\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}} \right) = \frac{Q}{500}\,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{min}}.
	$$
	
	Now we're ready to write down an expression for $Q'$, which has become a first-order DE.
	
	$$
		Q' = 0.2 - \frac{Q}{500}.
	$$
	
	In order to pin down a particular solution, we're going to need to know at least one value of $Q(t)$. That's where the $20\,\text{kg}$ comes in: $Q(0) = 20$. Now we can get to solving --- this DE is linear, so we can solve it with an integrating factor.
	
	$$
		Q' + \frac{Q}{500} &= 0.2
		
		\mu(t) &= \exp \left( \int \frac{1}{500}\,dt \right)
		
		\mu(t) &= \exp\left( \frac{t}{500} \right)
		
		\mu(t) &= e^{t / 500}
		
		e^{t / 500}Q' + \frac{1}{500} e^{t / 500} Q &= 0.2 e^{t / 500}
		
		\frac{d}{dt} \left[ e^{t / 500} Q \right] &= 0.2 e^{t / 500}
		
		e^{t / 500} Q &= \int 0.2 e^{t / 500}\,dt
		
		Q &= e^{-t / 500} \left( 0.2 \cdot 500 e^{t / 500} + c \right)
		
		Q &= 100 + c e^{-t / 500}.
	$$
	
	Now we can use the initial condition to solve for $c$ as usual:
	
	$$
		20 &= 100 + ce^{-0 / 500}
		
		c &= -80
		
		Q &= 100 - 80 e^{-t / 500}.
	$$
	
	The first value we're trying to find is $Q(30) \approx 24.66\,\text{kg}$, and the second is
	
	$$
		\lim_{t \to \infty} Q(t) = 100.
	$$
	
	Thankfully, that checks out with the problem! After a long enough time, the concentration in the tank will approach the concentration we're pouring in, which is $0.1,\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}}$, so we'd expect the mass to approach $0.1 \cdot 1000 = 100$.
	
###

### exc a mixing problem
	
	A $10$ liter tank of water contains $2\,\text{g}$ of sugar dissolved in it. We begin pouring in a sugar solution at a rate of $10\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$ with a concentration of $\cos(t) + 1\,\frac{\text{g}}{\text{L}}$ at time $t$ and draining the well-mixed solution at the same rate of $10\,\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}$. After $20$ minutes, what will the mass of sugar in the tank be, and what will the mass approach in the long term?
