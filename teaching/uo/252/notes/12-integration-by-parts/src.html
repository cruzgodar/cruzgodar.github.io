# Section 12: Integration by Parts

### nav-buttons

The only technique we have to compute integrals at the moment is $u$-sub, which is an analogue of the chain rule. What we&#x2019;ll introduce in this section is an analogue of the product rule. As before, it will look different in practice, but we&#x2019;ll see that it&#x2019;s really just the same thing in the end.

If $u$ and $v$ are differentiable functions, then

$$
	\frac{d}{dx} [uv] = \frac{d}{dx}[u] \cdot v + u \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[v].
$$

Equivalently,

$$
	u \cdot \frac{dv}{dx} = \frac{d(uv)}{dx} - v \cdot \frac{du}{dx}
$$

Taking the strange step of multiplying both sides of this equation by $dx$, we have

$$
	u\,dv = d(uv) - v\,du.
$$

And now if we integrate both sides, we get

$$
	\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du.
$$

This is the form we&#x2019;ll use, but just like with $u$-sub, we have a process to make it easier than having to interpret this somewhat obscure formula.



### thm integration by parts
	
	To evaluate $\int f(x) g(x)\,dx$ with integration by parts, we need to be able differentiate $f(x)$ and integrate $g(x)$. Let $u = f(x)$ and $dv = g(x)\,dx$. Then find $du = f'(x)\,dx$ and $v = \int g(x)\,dx$, and rewrite the integral as
	
	$$
		uv - \int v\,du.
	$$
	
	Then attempt to solve the integral left in this equation &mdash; if the process was successful, it will now be integrable. We may need to repeat the process on this new integral.

### ex integration by parts
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int x\sin(x)\,dx$.
	
	We can&#x2019;t do this directly, since we (probably) don&#x2019;t know a function whose derivative is $x\sin(x)$. There&#x2019;s also no composition here, so all we have left is integration by parts. The two parts are $x$ and $\sin(x)$, and we&#x2019;re going to differentiate one and integrate the other. If we integrate $x$, we&#x2019;re going to get $\frac{x^2}{2}$, and that&#x2019;s **more complicated**, which means it&#x2019;s probably a bad idea. Instead, let&#x2019;s try differentiating it. That means letting $u = x$ and $dv = \sin(x)\,dx$. Then $du = dx$ and
	
	$$
		v = \int \sin(x)\,dx = -\cos(x)
	$$
	
	(we drop the $+C$ until the end of the problem to keep things simple). Our integral now becomes
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int x\sin(x)\,dx &= uv - \int v\,du\\
			&= -x\cos(x) - \int -\cos(x)\,dx\\
			&= -x\cos(x) + \sin(x) + C.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
###

### exc integration by parts
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int ye^y\,dy$.
	
	**Solution:** just like in the last example, let $u = y$ and $dv = e^y\,dy$. Then $du = dy$ and $v = e^y$, so we get
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			ye^y - \int e^y\,dy &= ye^y - e^y + C.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
###



### ex integration by parts
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int \frac{\ln(t)}{t^2}\,dt$.
	
	There are lots of choices for $u$ and $dv$ &mdash; here are just a few:
	
	$$
		u = \ln(t),\,dv = \frac{1}{t^2}\,dt
	$$
	
	$$
		u = \frac{\ln(t)}{t^2},\,dv = dt
	$$
	
	$$
		u = \frac{1}{t},\,dv = \frac{\ln(t)}{t}\,dt
	$$
	
	In general, we want to choose $u$ and $dv$ such that the resulting integral is as simple as possible. For example, since the derivative of $\ln(t)$ is $\frac{1}{t}$ but the integral is $t\ln(t) - t + C$, we almost certainly want $\ln(t)$ to be part of $u$ instead of $dv$ so that it gets differentiated. The simplest way to do that is just to take $u = \ln(t)$ and $dv = \frac{1}{t^2}\,dt$ &mdash; let&#x2019;s see how that goes. We have $du = \frac{1}{t}\,dt$ and $v = -\frac{1}{t}$, so we get
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int \frac{\ln(t)}{t^2}\,dt &= -\frac{\ln(t)}{t} - \int -\frac{1}{t^2}\,dt\\
			&= -\frac{\ln(t)}{t} - \frac{1}{t} + C.
		\end{align*}
	$$

Sometimes, we&#x2019;ll need to apply integration by parts more than once.



### ex integration by parts twice
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int x^2 e^{3x}\,dx$.
	
	We know that $x^2$ gets simpler when we differentiate it, and $e^{3x}$ stays as complicated when integrated, so let&#x2019;s try $u = x^2$ and $dv = e^{3x}\,dx$. Then $du = 2x\,dx$ and $v = \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}$. Now the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int x^2 e^{3x}\,dx = \frac{1}{3} x^2 e^{3x} - \int \frac{2}{3} x e^{3x}\,dx.
	$$
	
	To evaluate this integral, we need to do integration by parts again. It works almost exactly the same as before: $u = \frac{2}{3} x$ and $dv = e^{3x}\,dx$. Then $du = \frac{2}{3}\,dx$ and $v = \frac{1}{3}e^{3x}$ once again, so we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int x^2 e^{3x}\,dx &= \frac{1}{3} x^2 e^{3x} - \int \frac{2}{3} x e^{3x}\,dx\\
			&= \frac{1}{3} x^2 e^{3x} - \left( \frac{2}{9} xe^{3x} - \int \frac{2}{9} e^{3x}\,dx \right)\\
			&= \frac{1}{3} x^2 e^{3x} - \frac{2}{9} x e^{3x} + \frac{2}{27} e^{3x} + C.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
###

### exc integration by parts twice
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int t^2 \cos(2t)\,dt$.
	
	**Solution:** by the same logic, let $u = t^2$ and $dv = \cos(2t)\,dt$. Then $du = 2t\,dt$ and $v = \frac{1}{2} \sin(2t)\,dt$, so the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{2}t^2\sin(2t) - \int \frac{1}{2} \sin(2t) (2t)\,dt = \frac{1}{2}t^2\sin(2t) - \int t \sin(2t)\,dt.
	$$
	
	This is similar to the previous examples we&#x2019;ve done: let $u = t$ and $dv = \sin(2t)\,dt$. Then $du = dt$ and $v = -\frac{1}{2} \cos(2t)$, so we get
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{2}t^2\sin(2t) - \left(-\frac{1}{2} t \cos(2t) - \int -\frac{1}{2} \cos(2t)\,dt \right) = \frac{1}{2}t^2\sin(2t) + \frac{1}{2} t \cos(2t) - \frac{1}{4} \sin(2t) + C.
	$$

Things can get a little more complicated when multiple integration strategies are involved. First of all, <strong>try $u$-sub first.</strong> If you&#x2019;re trying to integrate $x\sin(x^2)$, trying to do it by parts will never work, since it&#x2019;s impossible to integrate $\sin(x^2)$ without that extra $x$ for $u$-sub. If it doesn&#x2019;t seem like $u$-sub will help, then try integrating by parts. Sometimes you&#x2019;ll even need to use both.



### ex integration by parts and $u$-sub
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int y^3 e^{y^2}\,dy$.
	
	Let&#x2019;s follow the instructions above and try $u$-sub first. The only option is to let $u = y^2$ and $du = 2y\,dy$, which gives us
	
	$$
		\int \frac{1}{2} ue^u\,du.
	$$
	
	Now we have an integration by parts problem, since there is no composition in this integral and it&#x2019;s a product we don&#x2019;t know how to integrate. Normally we use $u$ and $v$ for variables, but now we&#x2019;ve already used $u$, so let&#x2019;s pick another variable &mdash; say $w$. Therefore, $w = \frac{1}{2} u$, $dv = e^u\,du$, and so $dw = \frac{1}{2}\,du$ and $v = e^u$. Now we get
	
	$$
		u e^u - \int \frac{1}{2} e^u\,du = u e^u - \frac{1}{2} e^u + C.
	$$
	
	Finally, we can back-substitute for $y$:
	
	$$
		y^2 e^{y^2} - \frac{1}{2} e^{y^2} + C.
	$$

### ex integration by parts on definite integrals
	
	The region bounded by $y = \cos(x)$, $y = 0$, and $x = 0$ is revolved about the $y$-axis. Find its volume.
	
	Since we&#x2019;re revolving about the $y$-axis and have a function given in terms of $x$, we should try the shell method first. The intersection of $\cos(x)$ with $y = 0$ gives $x = \frac{\pi}{2}$, so the integral comes out to
	
	$$
		\int_0^{\pi / 2} 2\pi x\cos(x)\,dx.
	$$
	
	Now we need to apply integration by parts to this. As usual, $u = 2\pi x$ and $dv = \cos(x)\,dx$, so $du = 2\pi\,dx$ and $v = \sin(x)$, but this example is different in that we have a definite integral. To handle that, we apply integration by parts and evaluate the entire expression.
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^{\pi / 2} 2\pi x\cos(x)\,dx &= \left. \left[ 2\pi x\sin(x) - \int 2\pi \sin(x)\,dx \right] \right|_0^{\pi / 2}\\
			&= \left. \left[ 2\pi x\sin(x) + 2\pi \cos(x) \right] \right|_0^{\pi / 2}\\
			&= \pi^2 - 2\pi.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
###

### exc integration by parts on definite integrals
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int_1^3 x^3 \sin(x^2)\,dx$.
	
	**Solution:** we see a composition ($\sin(x^2)$), so we should try $u$-sub before integrating by parts. Let $u = x^2$, so that $du = 2x\,dx$. Then $\frac{1}{2}\,du = x\,dx$, so the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_1^3 \frac{1}{2} u \sin(u)\,du.
	$$
	
	Now there&#x2019;s nothing left to do but integrate by parts. We&#x2019;re already using $u$ as a variable, so let&#x2019;s set $w = \frac{1}{2}u$ and $dv = \sin(u)\,du$. Then we have $dw = \frac{1}{2}\,du$ and $v = -\cos(u)$, so the integral becomes
	
	$$
		-\frac{1}{2} u \cos(u) + \int \frac{1}{2} \cos(u)\,du = -\frac{1}{2} u \cos(u) + \frac{1}{2} \sin(u).
	$$
	
	Now it&#x2019;s time to back-substitute for $u$.
	
	$$
		-\frac{1}{2} x^2 \cos(x^2) + \frac{1}{2} \sin(x^2).
	$$
	
	Finally, we can evaluate the integral limits.
	
	$$
		\left. \left[ -\frac{1}{2} x^2 \cos(x^2) + \frac{1}{2} \sin(x^2) \right] \right|_1^3 = \frac{1}{2} (\sin(9) - 9\cos(9) - \sin(1) + \cos(1)).
	$$
