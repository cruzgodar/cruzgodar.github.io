Up to this point, we've defined integrals via Riemann sums, related them to antiderivatives via the Fundamental Theorem, and then made taking antiderivatives a little easier with $u$-sub. Now, we'll extend what definite integrals can do by exploring how they can calculate area --- not just under a curve, but between two of them.



### prop area between curves
	
	Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be functions with $f(x) \geq g(x)$ on $[a, b]$. Then the area between the graphs of $f$ and $g$ on $[a, b]$ is
	
	$$
		\int_a^b (f(x) - g(x))\,dx.
	$$

### ex area between curves
	
	Find the area of the region bounded by $f(x) = x$ and $g(x) = x^2$.
	
	First, we need to actually figure out where that area is, so that we know the limits of integration.
	
	### desmos area-between-curves
	
	To find those limits, we set the two functions equal and solve for $x$. If $x = x^2$, then $x^2 - x = 0$, so $x(x-1) = 0$, and therefore $x = 0$ or $x = 1$. This reflects what we see in the graph. Since $f(x)$ is the function with the larger $y$-value on the region, our integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_0^1 (x - x^2)\,dx &= \left. \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^1
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3}
		
		&= \frac{1}{6}.
	$$

### exc area between curves
	
	Find the area of the region bounded by $y = 6 - x$ and $$y = 9 - \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^2$$.
	
	**Solution:** the intersection occurs when $6 - x = 9 - \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^2$. This gives $x = -2$ and $x = 6$. Now we can see which function is larger by evaulating them both somewhere in between, say at $0$: $6 - 0 = 6$ and $9 - \left( \frac{0}{2} \right)^2 = 9$. That means that the second one is the larger function, so we have
	
	$$
		\int_{-2}^6 \left(9 - \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^2 - (6 - x)\right)\,dx &= \int_{-2}^6 \left(3 + x - \frac{x^2}{4} \right)\,dx
		
		&= \left. \left[ 3x + \frac{x^2}{2} - \frac{x^3}{12} \right] \right|_{-2}^{6}
		
		&= 18 + \frac{10}{3}.
	$$
	
###



### ex more area between curves
	
	Find the area between $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ on $[0, \pi]$.
	
	This is a little more complicated: which function is on top changes across the interval. Setting $\sin(x) = \cos(x)$ is a problem from trigonometry: dividing both sides by $\cos(x)$ results in $\tan(x) = 1$, which on our interval is only true at $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$. So the functions meet at $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$, and since they're both continuous, that's the only possible place they could cross. Let's try some test points: plugging in $x = 0$ gives $\sin(0) = 0$ and $\cos(0) = 1$, so until $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$, $\cos$ is the larger function. Similarly, $x = \pi$ gives $\sin(\pi) = 0$ and $\cos(\pi) = -1$, so $\sin$ is larger after $\frac{\pi}{4}$. Therefore, we have
	
	$$
		&\ \ \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} (\cos(x) - \sin(x))\,dx + \int_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^\pi (\sin(x) - \cos(x))\,dx
		
		&= \left. \left[ \sin(x) + \cos(x) \right] \right|_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} + \left. \left[ -\cos(x) - \sin(x) \right] \right|_{\frac{\pi}{4}}^\pi
		
		&= \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 1 - 0 \right) + \left( 1 + 0 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
		
		&= 2\sqrt{2}.
	$$

### ex even more area between curves
	
	Find the area of the shaded region bounded by $y = 1$, $y = 3 - x$, and $y = x^2 + 1$, as pictured.
	
	### desmos area-between-curves-3
	
	First, let's find the limits of integration. The left one is the intersection of $y = x^2 + 1$ with $y = 1$: then $x^2 + 1 = 1$, so $x = 0$. The right endpoint is the intersection of $y = 3 - x$ with $y = 1$, so $x = 2$. Like the last example, though, the bounding functions change as we move left to right along the interval. The point where we switch from $x^2 + 1$ to $3 - x$ being the top function is the intersection of the two: $x^2 + 1 = 3 - x$, so $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$. Factoring this gives $x = 1$ or $x = -2$, and we clearly want $x = 1$. Now the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_0^1 (x^2 + 1 - 1)\,dx + \int_1^2 (3 - x - 1)\,dx &= \left. \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^1 + \left. \left[ 2x - \frac{x^2}{2} \right] \right|_1^2
		
		&= \frac{1}{3} + \left( 4 - 2 - 2 + \frac{1}{2} \right)
		
		&= \frac{5}{6}.
	$$

	### desmos area-between-curves-4
	
	**Solution:** $f$ and $h$ intersect at $x = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$, $g$ and $h$ intersect at $x = 1$, and $f$ and $g$ intersect at $x = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}$. To save notation, let's call the first number $a$, the second one $b$, and the third one $c$. Then the integral becomes $\int_a^c (h(x) - f(x))\,dx + \int_c^b (h(x) - g(x))\,dx$. This comes out to
	
	$$
		\left(\frac{7}{7} - \frac{7}{6}\sqrt{5} + \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\sqrt{5} - 2}\right) - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3}\sqrt{5} - \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{\sqrt{5} - 2}\right).
	$$

Sometimes --- particularly in cases like the previous example with multiple bounding functions, we can make things much simpler by changing the variable we integrate with respect to. This is not $u$-sub, but something else entirely: integrating with respect to $y$. Let's redo the previous example to see how it works.



### ex integrating with respect to $y$.
	
	Find the area of the shaded region bounded by $y = 1$, $y = 3 - x$, and $y = x^2 + 1$ by integrating with respect to $y$.
	
	### desmos area-between-curves-5
	
	The first thing to do is rewrite the functions as **functions of $y$**. That means solving each one for $x$: $y = 3 - x$ becomes $x = 3 - y$, and $y = x^2 + 1$ becomes $x = \sqrt{y - 1}$. Since there is no $x$ in $y = 1$, we can't solve it for $x$, but we'll see that that won't be a problem momentarily.
	
	Now we need to identify the limits, which are $y$-values now. The minimum $y$-value is clearly $y = 1$, and to find the maximum one, we intersect the other two functions. That gave us $x = 1$ before, but we want the $y$-value this time, so we can just plug $x = 1$ into either formula to get $y = 2$. Alternatively, we could have just solved $\sqrt{y - 1} = 3 - y$.
	
	The next thing to reverse is the way the integral is set up. Normally we take the top function minus the bottom one --- i.e. the larger $y$-value minus the smaller $y$-value. Now we're using $x$ instead, so to take the larger $x$-value minus the smaller $x$-value, we take the right function minus the left one. And here's the reason this is an easier way to do things for this example in particular: the right and left functions stay the same across the entire region, so there's no need to split up the region. We just have
	
	$$
		\int_1^2 (3 - y - \sqrt{y - 1})\,dy &= \int_1^2 (3 - y)\,dy - \int_1^2 \sqrt{y - 1}\,dy
		
		& u = y - 1,\,du = dy
		
		&= \int_1^2 (3 - y)\,dy - \int_1^2 \sqrt{u}\,du
		
		&= \left. \left[ 3y - \frac{y^2}{2} \right] \right|_1^2 - \left. \left[ \frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} \right] \right|_1^2
		
		&= \left. \left[ 3y - \frac{y^2}{2} \right] \right|_1^2 - \left. \left[ \frac{(y-1)^{3/2}}{3/2} \right] \right|_1^2
		
		&= \left( 6 - 2 - 3 + \frac{1}{2} \right) - \left( \frac{1}{3/2} \right)
		
		&= \frac{3}{2} - \frac{2}{3}
		
		&= \frac{5}{6},
	$$
	
	which agrees with what we got before.

	Find the area of the shaded region bounded by $y = 1 - x$, $y = x^2$, and $y = \sqrt{x}$ by integrating with respect to $y$.
	
	### desmos area-between-curves-6
	
	**Solution:** the functions are now $1 - y$, $\sqrt{y}$, and $y^2$. The integrals are actually exactly the same, since they intersect at the same $y$-coordinates as the previous $x$-coordinates.

In general, you'll need to choose which variable is better to integrate with respect to. Sometimes one will be a little easier than the other, and other times only one will be possible at all. Integrating with respect to $y$ will continue to crop up throughout the coming sections, so it's a good thing to get accustomed to sooner rather than later.
