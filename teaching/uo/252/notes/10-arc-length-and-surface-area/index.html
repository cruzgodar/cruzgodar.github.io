	We&#x2019;re going to take a welcome break from 3D objects to talk about a simpler application of integrals... and then we&#x2019;ll get right back to the 3D stuff later this section. Let&#x2019;s open with what arc length means, and then we&#x2019;ll see how to compute it.
	
!end-text-block



!begin-def
	
	arc length
	
	The arc length of a function $f(x)$ on $[a, b]$ is the length of the graph of $f$ between $x = a$ and $x = b$.
	
!end-def



!begin-example
	
	arc length
	
	The arc length of $f(x) = 2x + 1$ on $[0, 2]$ is $\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{20}$.

!begin-text-block
	
	As is becoming standard, we don&#x2019;t really know how to do anything but the simplest case of straight lines, but as long as the function is smooth, we can approximate it with a bunch of small straight lines.

!begin-text-block
	
	Let&#x2019;s take a look at one of those small line segments. Say it has rise $\Delta y$ and run $\Delta x$. Then its length is $\sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}$ by the Pythagorean theorem. Factor out the $\Delta x^2$ to get $\Delta x \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \right)^2}$. Now as $\Delta x \to 0$, the approximation gets better and better. $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \to f'(x)$, and $\Delta x \to dx$. Since we&#x2019;re adding up all of the segment lengths, we need to integrate what we get, which in total has become...

!begin-thm
	
	arc length
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function on $[a, b]$. The arc length of $f$ is
	
	$$
		\int_a^b \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}\ dx.
	$$
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	arc length
	
	Find the arc length of $f(x) = 2x^{3/2}$ on $[0, 1]$.
	
	We have $f'(x) = 3x^{1/2}$, so $f'(x)^2 = 9x$. Thus the arc length is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			& \int_0^1 \sqrt{1 + 9x}\ dx\\
			& u = 1 + 9x, du = 9\ dx\\
			&= \frac{1}{9} \int_0^1 \sqrt{u}\ du\\
			&= \frac{1}{9} \left. \left[ \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \right] \right|_0^1\\
			&= \frac{1}{9} \left. \left[ \frac{2}{3} (1 + 9x)^{3/2} \right] \right|_0^1\\
			&= \frac{2}{27} \left( (10)^{3/2} - 1 \right)\\
			&\approx 2.27.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
!end-example

!begin-exercise
	
	arc length
	
	Find the arc length of $y = x^{2/3}$ on $[0, 2]$. (Hint: rewrite it as a function of $y$.)
	
	Solution: as a function of $y$, we have $x = y^{3/2}$, and the interval runs from $y = 0^{3/2} = 0$ to $y = 2^{3/2} = \sqrt{8}$. As before, we have $f'(y) = 3y^{1/2}$, so $f'(y)^2 = 9y$. Then the arc length is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			& \int_0^{\sqrt{8}} \sqrt{1 + 9y}\ dy\\
			& u = 1 + 9y, du = 9\ dy\\
			&= \frac{1}{9} \int_0^{\sqrt{8}} \sqrt{u}\ du\\
			&= \frac{1}{9} \left. \left[ \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \right] \right|_0^{\sqrt{8}}\\
			&= \frac{1}{9} \left. \left[ \frac{2}{3} (1 + 9x)^{3/2} \right] \right|_0^{\sqrt{8}}\\
			&= \frac{2}{27} \left( (1 + 9\sqrt{8})^{3/2} - 1 \right).
		\end{align*}

!text s Surface Area

<br>



!begin-text-block
	
	Onto the next part. We know how to find the volume of a solid of revolution, but what about its surface area? This is thankfully much easier &mdash; repeating the same straight-line argument but scaling by $2 \pi f(x)$ &mdash; the circumference of a circle &mdash; changes the integral to adding up lots of thin circles around the outside of the solid, which is exactly what we need.

!begin-thm
	
	surface area
	
	Let $f(x)$ be a differentiable function on $[a, b]$. The surface area of the solid of revolution generated by revolving the graph of $f$ about the $x$-axis is
	
	$$
		\int_a^b 2\pi f(x) \sqrt{1 + f'(x)^2}\ dx.
	$$
	
!end-thm



!begin-example
	
	surface area
	
	Find the surface area of the solid created by revolving the graph of $y = x^2$ on $[0, 6]$ about the $y$-axis.
	
	Unlike volume, where we have a choice between integrating with respect to either variable (i.e. using the disk vs. shell methods), here we only have a theorem that can be used when we integrate with respect to the same variable whose axis we revolved about. Here that&#x2019;s the $y$-axis, so we need to get everything in terms of $y$. $y = x^2$ gets rewritten as $x = \sqrt{y}$, and $x = 0$ to $x = 6$ corresponds to $y = 0$ to $y = 36$. Then we have $f'(y) = \frac{1}{2} y^{-1/2}$, so the surface area is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_0^{36} 2 \pi \sqrt{y} \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{4} y^{-1}}\ dy &= 2\pi \int_0^{36} \sqrt{y + \frac{1}{4}}\ dy\\
			& u = y + \frac{1}{4}, du = dy\\
			&= 2\pi \int_0^{36} \sqrt{u}\ du\\
			&= 2\pi \left. \left[ \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \right] \right|_0^{36}\\
			&= 2\pi \left. \left[ \frac{2}{3} \left( y + \frac{1}{4} \right)^{3/2} \right] \right|_0^{36}\\
			&= \frac{4\pi}{3} \left( \left( 36 + \frac{1}{4} \right)^{3/2} - \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^{3/2} \right).
		\end{align*}
	$$

!begin-exercise
	
	surface area
	
	Find the surface area of the solid created by revolving the graph of $y = x$ on $[1, 3]$ about the $x$-axis.
	
	Solution: we have $f'(x) = 1$, so $(f'(x))^2 = 1$. Then the integral becomes
	
	$$
		\int_1^3 2\pi x \sqrt{2}\ dx = 2\pi\sqrt{2}\left( \frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right).
	$$
