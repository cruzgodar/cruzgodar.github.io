# Section 5: Simple Applications

### nav-buttons

With the hardest conceptual work behind us, let&#x2019;s turn to some simple applications of integrals. The first one we&#x2019;ve touched on before, and you probably saw plenty of it in calc I: the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration. Remember that **displacement** means signed distance: if you move $3$ meters right and $2$ left, then your net displacement is only $1$ meter, while your total distance traveled is $5$.



### ex displacement
	
	A particle is traveling in a straight line with a velocity of $v(t) = 3t - 5 \frac{m}{s}$ after $t$ seconds. Find the net displacement of the particle over $3$ seconds and its total distance traveled.
	
	Let&#x2019;s start with net displacement, which is just $s(3) - s(0)$. Since $s$ is an antiderivative of $v$, we have that
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			s(3) - s(0) &= \int_0^3 v(t)\,dt\\
			&= \int_0^3 (3t - 5)\,dt\\
			&= \left. \left[ \frac{3}{2}t^2 - 5t \right] \right|_0^3\\
			&= \left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot 9 - 15 \right) - 0\\
			&= -\frac{3}{2}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, the particle ended up $1.5$ meters to the left of where it started after $3$ seconds.
	
	This is just the end result, though, and it doesn&#x2019;t tell us how much the particle moved in total. For that, there&#x2019;s an easy change we can make: rather than integrating $v$, which is sometimes negative and sometimes positive, we&#x2019;ll integrate $|v|$. This makes all velocity count as positive, whether it&#x2019;s to the left or right, and so integrating that will give us total distance traveled. There&#x2019;s some nuance to just taking that absolute value, though, because we need to know <em>when</em> $v$ is positive and when it&#x2019;s negative. To do this, we&#x2019;ll first set it equal to zero: if $3t - 5 = 0$, then $t = \frac{5}{3}$, and since $v$ is a line with positive slope, it must be negative for $t &lt; \frac{5}{3}$ and positive for $t > \frac{5}{3}$. In order to take the absolute value, we need to negate $v$ when it&#x2019;s negative and not when it&#x2019;s positive. This means doing different things on different parts of the domain, so we need to split up the integral itself. If we let $s_{\text{tot}}(t)$ be the total distance traveled after $t$ seconds, then we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			s_{\text{tot}}(3) - s_{\text{tot}}(0) &= \int_0^3 |v(t)|\,dt\\
			&= \int_0^{\frac{5}{3}} -v(t)\,dt + \int_{\frac{5}{3}}^3 v(t)\,dt\\
			&= -\int_0^{\frac{5}{3}} (3t - 5)\,dt + \int_{\frac{5}{3}}^3 (3t - 5)\,dt\\
			&= -\left. \left[ \frac{3}{2}t^2 - 5t \right] \right|_0^{\frac{5}{3}} + \left. \left[ \frac{3}{2}t^2 - 5t \right] \right|_{\frac{5}{3}}^3\\
			&= -\left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{9} - \frac{25}{3} \right) - 0 + \left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot 9 - 15 \right) - \left( \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{25}{9} - \frac{25}{3} \right)\\
			&= \frac{41}{6}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The particle therefore traveled a total of $\frac{41}{6} \approx 6.83$ meters total.

### exc displacement
	
	A particle moves at velocity $v(t) = 4t^2 - 16t + 12$. Find its net displacement and total distance traveled between time $t = 0$ and $t = 4$.
	
	**Solution:** The net displacement is
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			s(4) - s(0) &= \int_0^4 v(t)\,dt\\
			&= \int_0^4 (4t^2 - 16t + 12)\,dt\\
			&= \left. \left[ 4\frac{t^3}{3} - 8t^2 + 12t \right] \right|_0^4\\
			&= \frac{16}{3}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The total distance requires integrating $|v(t)|$, so we need to know when $v(t) < 0$. To do that, we solve $v(t) = 0$ to get
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			4t^2 - 16t + 12 &= 0\\
			t^2 - 4t + 3 &= 0\\
			(t - 1)(t - 3) &= 0\\
			t = 1, & t = 3.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Plugging in some test points, $v(0) = 12 > 0$, $v(2) = -4$, and $v(4) = 12$. Therefore, the only region where $v$ is negative is $(1, 3)$, so the absolute value is defined by
	
	$$
		|v(t)| = \begin{cases} 4t^2 - 16t + 12, & t \leq 1 \\ -(4t^2 - 16t + 12), & 1 \leq t \leq 3 \\ 4t^2 - 16t + 12, & 3 \leq t \end{cases}.
	$$
	
	In total, the integral is
	
	$$
		\int_0^4 |v(t)|\,dt = \int_0^1 (4t^2 - 16t + 12)\,dt + \int_1^3 -(4t^2 - 16t + 12)\,dt + \int_3^4 (4t^2 - 16t + 12)\,dt,
	$$
	
	which, after a lot of integration, reduces to exactly $16$.

Let&#x2019;s finish the section with something a little easier. You might have seen even and odd functions before &mdash; let&#x2019;s briefly review what they are.



### def even and odd functions
	
	A function $f$ is **even** if $f(-x) = f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain, and **odd** if $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$ in its domain.
	
###



Geometrically, even functions are ones whose graphs are symmetric about the $y$-axis, and odd functions are ones whose graphs are symmetric when rotated 180 degrees about the origin. For example, $x^4 - x^2$ is even, while $\sin(x)$ is odd.

### desmos even-and-odd-functions



### prop integrals of even and odd functions
	
	Let $f$ be an even function. Then
	
	$$
		\int_{-a}^a f(x)\,dx = 2\int_0^a f(x)\,dx.
	$$
	
	Let $g$ be an odd function. Then
	
	$$
		\int_{-a}^a f(x)\,dx = 0.
	$$
	
###



This shouldn&#x2019;t be terribly surprising. If a function is even and we&#x2019;re integrating over an interval centered at $0$, then the total area is evenly split over the parts to the left and right of $x = 0$. If the function is odd, then those two areas exactly cancel out instead.



### ex integrals of even and odd functions
	
	We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_{-2}^2 (x^4 - x^2)\,dx &= 2\int_0^2 (x^4 - x^2)\,dx\\
			&= 2 \left. \left[ \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^3}{3} \right] \right|_0^2\\
			&= 2 \left(\frac{32}{5} - \frac{8}{3}\right)\\
			&= \frac{112}{15}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	And
	
	$$
		\int_{-2}^2 (x^5)\,dx = 0.
	$$
	
###

### exc integrals of even and odd functions
	
	Find $\displaystyle \int_{-\pi}^\pi \sin(\theta)\,d\theta$ and $\displaystyle \int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos(\theta)\,d\theta$ by using properties of even and odd functions.
	
	**Solution:** Since $\sin$ is an odd function and $[-\pi, \pi]$ is centered at zero,
	
	$$
		\int_{-\pi}^\pi \sin(\theta)\,d\theta = 0.
	$$
	
	Similarly, since $\cos$ is even,
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos(\theta)\,d\theta &= 2\int_0^\pi \cos(\theta)\,d\theta\\
			&= 2 \left. \left[ \sin(\theta) \right] \right|_0^\pi\\
			&= 2 (\sin(\pi) - \sin(0))\\
			&= 0.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	The symmetry of the graph of $\cos$ on $[0, \pi]$ caused its integral to be zero too, even though it wasn&#x2019;t an odd function. 
	
###



In the next section, we&#x2019;ll start talking about the first technique we have to calculate more complicated integrals.
