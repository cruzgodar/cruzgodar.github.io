# Section 7: Power Series

### nav-buttons

In this section, we&#x2019;ll fundamentally change the way we look at and work with series. The change seems innocent enough at first, but its effects will be surprisingly profound.

Let&#x2019;s begin with the geometric series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty r^n$. Right now, we typically think of $r$ as a parameter we can choose before working with the series &mdash; for example, with $r = \frac{1}{2}$, we have the series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2.
$$

Now, though, we&#x2019;ll think of $r$ as a **variable**, specifically as an input to a function $f$. To emphasize that change, let&#x2019;s use $x$ instead of $r$. Our series now becomes

$$
	f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n.
$$

We know from properties of geometric series that this converges to $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ when $|x| < 1$. Therefore, we have that $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x}$, defined on the interval $(-1, 1)$.

What if we wanted to change that interval? The easiest way is to modify $x$. The series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (x - 8)^n
$$

converges when $|x - 8| < 1$, or in other words, when $x$ is in the interval $(7, 9)$.

So far, all we&#x2019;ve done is rename a variable to $x$ and introduce a small transformation to the series. But this type of series will form the basis for the rest of the course, and we&#x2019;d do well to give it a name.



### def power series
	
	A **power series** centered at $a$ is a series of the form
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n (x - a)^n
	$$
	
	for some constants $a$ and $c_n$. Note that the series starts at $n = 0$.

###



To make sure that power series are always defined, we&#x2019;ll insist that $(x - a)^0 = 1$, even when $x = a$.

A power series centered at $a$ always converges when $x = a$, since every term after the first is zero. Some power series <em>only</em> converge for that value of $x$ and no others &mdash; for example, take the series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n!x^n.
$$

This is a power series centered at zero, and when $x = 0$, it converges to zero as we expect. When $x$ is nonzero, we can apply the ratio test:

$$
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(n+1)!x^{n + 1}}{n!x^n} \right| &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| (n+1)x \right|\\
		&= \begin{cases} \infty, & x \neq 0 \\ 0, & x = 0 \end{cases}.
	\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, the series converges only for $x = 0$ and diverges otherwise.

We&#x2019;ve seen that other power series converge for $x$ inside of an interval and diverge otherwise, like $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$. One final possibility is that they converge no matter what $x$ is. For an example of that sort of behavior, let&#x2019;s look at the series

$$
	\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}.
$$

This time around, the ratio test tells us that

$$
	\begin{align*}
		\lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{x^{n + 1}}{(n+1)!}}{\frac{x^n}{n!}} \right| &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{n!x^{n+1}}{(n+1)!x^n} \right|\\
		&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{x}{n + 1} \right|\\
		&= 0.
	\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, the series always converges, regardless of the value of $x$.

It turns out that these are the *only* three possibilities for the convergence of a power series &mdash; and in fact, when they converge for $x$ in some interval, we can be more precise about what that interval looks like.



### thm convergence of power series
	
	Let
	
	$$
		f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n(x - a)^n
	$$
	
	be a power series centered at $a$. Then one of the following must be true:
	
	1. $f$ converges when $x = a$ and diverges for all other $x$.
	
	2. $f$ converges when $x$ is in some interval centered at $a$ and diverges otherwise.
	
	3. $f$ converges for all values of $x$.

###



In case 2, what we mean by an interval centered at $a$ is something of the form $(a - R, a + R)$, where $R$ is some positive number. For example, the series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$ has $R = 1$, since it converges on $(-1, 1)$. The interval of convergence can also sometimes include its endpoints, which we denote with square brackets, as in $[a - R, a + R]$.

These three cases can all be collected into one, and it even helpfully comes along with its own definition.



### def radius of convergence

	Let $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty c_n(x - a)^n$ be a power series centered at $a$. The **radius of convergence** $R$ of $f$ is half the width of the interval on which $f$ converges. If $f$ converges only at $a$, we say $R = 0$, and if it converges everywhere, we say $R = \infty$.

###



For example, $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$ has a radius of convergence of $R = 1$, and $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty n!x^n$ has $R = 0$.



### exc radius of convergence
	
	Find the radius and interval of convergence of the following series.
	
	1. $f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(x + 1)^n}{2^n(n + 1)}$.
	
	2. $g(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{\sqrt{n}}$.
	
	**Solutions:**
	
	1. With all the exponents (and no $n$s in the bases), let&#x2019;s try the ratio test. We have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{(x + 1)^{n + 1}}{2^{n + 1}(n + 2)}}{\frac{(x + 1)^n}{2^n(n + 1)}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(x + 1)^{n + 1}2^n(n + 1)}{(x + 1)^n 2^{n + 1}(n + 2)} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{(x + 1)(n + 1)}{2(n + 2)} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} |x + 1| \frac{n + 1}{2n + 4}\\
			&= \frac{1}{2} |x + 1|.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	Therefore, this series converges when $r = \frac{1}{2} |x + 1| < 1$. Solving for $x$, we have
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			|x + 1| &< 2\\
			-2 < x + 1 &< 2\\
			-3 < x &< 1.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	So the interval of convergence is at least $(-3, 1)$, but what about the endpoints? That&#x2019;s when $r = 1$ in the ratio test, so we need to try something else. When $x = -3$, the series becomes 
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-2)^n}{2^n(n + 1)} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{n + 1}.
	$$
	
	That&#x2019;s just the Alternating Harmonic series, which converges. For $x = 1$, though, it&#x2019;s the regular Harmonic series, which diverges. In total, the interval of convergence is $[-3, 1)$, and the radius is $R = 2$. As a good check, the center of that interval is $-1$, which matches the series containing $(x + 1)^n$.
	
	2. The ratio test is also a good choice here:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			r &= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{\frac{x^{n + 1}}{\sqrt{n + 1}}}{\frac{x^n}{\sqrt{n}}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} \left| \frac{x\sqrt{n}}{\sqrt{n + 1}} \right|\\
			&= \lim_{n \to \infty} |x| \sqrt{\frac{n}{n + 1}}\\
			&= |x|.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	This time, the series converges when $|x| < 1$, or equivalently, when $-1 < x < 1$. Again, the ratio test failed to tell us anything about the endpoints, so we&#x2019;ll have to inspect those manually. When $x = -1$, we have
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{\sqrt{n}},
	$$
	
	which converges by the alternating series test. When $x = 1$, it&#x2019;s a $p$-series with $p = \frac{1}{2} \leq 1$, which diverges. Therefore, the interval of convergence is $[-1, 1)$, and the radius of convergence is $R = 1$.

###



By starting with the geometric series $\sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$ and modifying it slightly, we can represent functions that look like $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ as power series.



### ex representing a function as a power series
	
	Write $f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + 3x^2}$ as a power series, and state the interval and radius of convergence.
	
	First of all, if we&#x2019;re going to use the fact that $\frac{1}{1 - x} = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty x^n$, we&#x2019;d like our numerator to be equal to $1$. To get us to that point, we&#x2019;ll factor out the $x$ and deal with $\frac{1}{1 + 3x^2}$ on its own. To make it conform to the format we know, the denominator should be $1$ minus something instead of $1$ plus something, so we&#x2019;ll rewrite it as
	
	$$
		\frac{1}{1 - (-3x^2)}.
	$$
	
	Now when $|-3x^2| < 1$, this is equal to
	
	$$
		\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3x^2)^n = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3)^n x^{2n}.
	$$
	
	Now we just need to multiply by $x$, which increases the power on $x$ by 1:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			f(x) &= x\sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3)^n x^{2n}\\
			&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-3)^n x^{2n + 1}.
		\end{align*}
	$$
	
	So when does this converge? We need $|-3x^2| = 3|x^2| < 1$, so $|x^2| < \frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, $|x| < \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$. Our radius of convergence is therefore $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, and the interval is
	
	$$
		\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right).
	$$

###

### exc representing a function as a power series
	
	Write the function $g(x) = \frac{x^3}{2 + x^2}$ as a power series, and find the interval and radius of convergence. Hint: $2 + x^2 = 2\left(1 + \frac{x^2}{2}\right)$.
	
	**Solution:** as in the example, we&#x2019;ll rewrite this to look like $\frac{1}{1 - x}$:
	
	$$
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{x^3}{2 + x^2} &= \frac{x^3}{2} \frac{1}{1 - \left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)}\\
			&= \frac{x^3}{2} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)^n\\
			&= \frac{x^3}{2} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n 2^{-n} x^{2n}\\
			&= \sum_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n 2^{-n - 1} x^{2n + 3}.
		\end{align*}	
	$$
	
	This series converges when $\left|-\frac{x^2}{2}\right| < 1$, so we need $x^2 < 2$. Therefore, the interval of convergence is $\left( -\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2} \right)$, and the radius is $\sqrt{2}$.
