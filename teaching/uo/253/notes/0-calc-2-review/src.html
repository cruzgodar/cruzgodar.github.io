# Section 0: Calculus I and II Review

### nav-buttons



Welcome to Math 253! You're viewing the interactive lecture notes --- reading these is required for the class, since we'll have a very short reading quiz on Canvas due before most lectures. To get started, let's make sure your browser handles equations and graphs correctly. You should see an equation on its own line below and a graph below that.

$$
	x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

If anything doesn't appear correctly, update your browser and then reach out if that doesn't work. There's also a non-interactive pdf version of each document available for compatibility --- let me know if you need them.

Calculus III is something of a transitional course. While the material directly follows the first two courses in the calculus sequence, and the amount of topics covered is significantly lower than calculus II, the level of rigor is quite a bit higher. Solutions to problems are much more concerned with processes over final answers, and the concepts themselves are a little bit more abstract than what's come before. More than ever, you'll need to learn and use definitions and theorems as they're formally written, as well as understand them intuitively. While it sounds like a lot to ask, the good news is that this course is as gentle an introduction to these higher expectations as could be hoped.

The expectation for a four unit class is to spend eight hours a week outside of class on studying and homework. Even if you haven't needed that much time in previous math courses, **budget that much for this one.** One of the best things you can do is to find two office hours you can regularly make per week, and commit to always attending them. Even if you don't have questions, it's a great environment to focus on homework, make friends to study with, and get help if questions do come up. Most students who consistently attend office hours succeed in the course, and most students who succeed regularly attend them.

Before we dive into the new material, let's take a section to go over the core concepts of calculus so far to make sure we're all on the same page.



## Limits

The **limit** as $x$ approaches $a$ of a function $f(x)$, written $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$, is a concept that lets us talk about what value $f$ ought to have at $x = a$, without knowing what value $f(a)$ actually takes, or if it's even defined at all. For example, with the function $g$ defined by

$$
	g(t) = \frac{\sin(t)}{t},
$$

we have that $g(0) = \frac{\sin(0)}{0} = \frac{0}{0}$, which is undefined. However, we can take the limit (and use L'H&#244;pital's rule) to find that

$$
	\lim_{t \to 0} g(t) &= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\frac{d}{dt} [\sin(t)] }{\frac{d}{dt}[t]}
	
	&= \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\cos(t)}{1}
	
	&= \frac{1}{1}
	
	&= 1.
$$

Even though $g(0)$ is undefined, the value we'd expect it to take is $1$.

### desmos limit-example

Limits split across addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and even function composition. Moreover, most functions we commonly work with are **continuous** wherever they are defined. A function $f$ is continuous at $x = a$ if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$; in other words, the value is what we would expect.

The limit $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ can fail to exist if values of $f(x)$ near $x = a$ fail to settle down to one specific value, or if approaching from the left yields a different result than approaching from the right.



## Derivatives

Derivatives measure slopes of tangent lines. The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at $x = a$ is defined as

$$
	f'(a) = \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]|_{x = a} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h},
$$

if the limit exists. The function inside the limit is the slope of a secant line passing through the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(a + h, f(a + h))$, and as $h \to 0$, that secant line approaches a tangent line.

### desmos secant-line-example

In order for a function to be differentiable, it must be continuous, but not all continuous functions are differentiable: for example, $f(x) = |x|$ is not differentiable at $x = 0$ due to the sharp corner.

In practice, we don't use the limit definition of the derivative all that often. Instead, we use derivative rules, like the product, quotient, and chain rules, and we memorize a handful of common derivatives to use as building blocks.



### prop derivative rules
	
	1. $$\frac{d}{dx} [c \cdot f(x)] = c \cdot f'(x)$$.
	
	2. $$\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)$$.
	
	3. $$\frac{d}{dx} [f(x)g(x)] = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$$ (the product rule).
	
	4. $$\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}$$ (the quotient rule).
	
	5. $$\frac{d}{dx} [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))g'(x)$$ (the chain rule).
	
###

### prop common derivatives
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [c] = 0$$ for any constant $c$.
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [x^p] = px^{p - 1}, p \neq 0$$ (the power rule).
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [\sin(x)] = \cos(x)$$.
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [\cos(x)] = -\sin(x)$$.
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [\tan(x)] = \sec^2(x)$$.
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [\sec(x)] = \sec(x)\tan(x)$$.
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [b^x] = b^x \ln(b)$$.
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [e^x] = e^x$$.
	
	$$\frac{d}{dx} [\ln(x)] = \frac{1}{x}$$.

We'll be using limits and derivatives heavily throughout the course. I have a full set of interactive notes available for calculus I --- brush up with those if you're feeling rusty.

## Integrals

The final building blocks we'll need are integrals. They come in two flavors: definite and indefinite. Indefinite integrals perform the opposite operation as derivatives, taking a function $f(x)$ to an antiderivative, often denoted $F(x)$. For example,

$$\int x^2\,dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + C$$.

$$\int \sin(2x)\,dx = -\frac{1}{2}\cos(2x) + C$$.

$$\int \frac{1}{y}\,dy = \ln|y| + C$$.

In contrast, definite integrals measure the area under the graph of a function and take an extra two numbers, written above and below the integral sign. When we say that

$$
	\int_{-2}^4 t^3\,dt = 60,
$$

we mean that the shaded region in the graph below has area 60. Remember that area below the $x$-axis counts as negative.

### desmos definite-integral-example

The two types of integrals are connected through the **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**, which relates area under curves to antiderivatives.



### thm The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
	
	Let $f$ be an integrable function. Then
	
	$$
		\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \left. \left[ \int f(x)\,dx \right] \right|_a^b = F(b) - F(a).
	$$	
	
###



In other words, definite integrals can be calculated by taking an antiderivative, then evaluating that from $a$ to $b$.

Much of the study of integrals is devoted to their applications, but we won't need many of those in this class. What we will occasionally need is techniques of integration --- these are analogous to derivative rules, but are usually quite a bit harder to use. The most common is $u$-sub, which helps with integrating compositions.



### ex $u$-sub
	
	Find the area under the graph of $f(x) = x \sin(x^2)$ between $x = 0$ and $x = \sqrt{\pi}$.
	
	As an integral, this is 
	
	$$
		\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi}} x \sin(x^2)\,dx.
	$$
	
	Since $\sin(x^2)$ is a composition of $\sin(x)$ and $x^2$, let's try $u$-sub. We let $u = x^2$, the inner function, and then differentiate to find that $du = 2x\,dx$. Present in our integral is $x\,dx$, not $2x\,dx$, so we divide by $2$ to get $\frac{1}{2}\,du = x\,dx$, which matches our integral. Now we have
	
	$$
		\int_0^{\sqrt{\pi}} x \sin(x^2)\,dx &= \int_0^{\sqrt{\pi}} \frac{1}{2} \sin(u)\,du
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} \int_0^{\sqrt{\pi}} \sin(u)\,du
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} \left. \left[ -\cos(u) \right] \right|_0^{\sqrt{\pi}}
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} \left. \left[ - \cos(x^2) \right] \right|_0^{\sqrt{\pi}}
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} \left( -\cos \left( \sqrt{\pi}^2 \right) + \cos(0^2) \right)
		
		&= \frac{1}{2} \left( -(-1) + 1 \right)
		
		&= 1.
	$$
	
	Therefore, the area under the graph is exactly 1.

The other commonly-used integration techniques are integration by parts, trig sub, and partial fractions. We won't use these too often, but they're good to know. If they don't feel familiar, or if calculus II in general is a little fuzzy, have a look at those notes.
