But what if we just got close &mdash; what does the boundary between order and chaos look like? It&#x2019;s a little unclear what we&#x2019;re even asking here, but it turns out math is well-equipped to provide an answer. We can see an example of this kind of boundary in the Kicked Rotator. It&#x2019;s a beautiful-looking image that resembles something like tidal flow, and in fact, that&#x2019;s not too far off. It plots the angle and momentum of a pendulum that sits in an antigravity chamber &mdash; but one where we turn the gravity on and off periodically. Loops and paths in the image here represent a change in the pendulum&#x2019;s angle and momentum over time &mdash; so if the pendulum is at a point on a red loop in the center, it will never reach a green point, no matter how much time passes. The cyan band that looks thicker than the others indicates some chaos &mdash; the pendulum is moving between many more states than a line&#x2019;s worth.</p><p class="body-text">By varying the strength of the gravity, which we represent with the letter <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="K">$K$,</span> we can alter the paths the pendulum takes. The higher <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="K">$K$</span> is, the more chaotic the system gets, until chaos begins to take over completely at around <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="K = .97">$K = .97$,</span> obliterating all structure by <span class="tex-holder inline-math" data-source-tex="K = 2">$K = 2$.</span> And so these Kicked Rotators give us a glimpse of the transition between order and chaos, with one slowly overtaking the other. It&#x2019;s a beautiful testament to the fragility of systems like these, especially when our universe is little more than a massive dynamical system itself.</p><div id="canvas-landscape"><div id="canvas-landscape-left"><div class='text-boxes'><div class="text-box-container"><input id="resolution-input" class="text-box" type="text" value="" tabindex="1"><p class="body-text text-box-subtext"></p></div><div class="text-box-container"><input id="k-input" class="text-box" type="text" value="" tabindex="1"><p class="body-text text-box-subtext"></p></div></div><div class='text-buttons'><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button" type="button" id="generate-button" tabindex="-1"></button></div></div></div><div id="canvas-landscape-middle"><canvas id='output-canvas' class='output-canvas'></canvas></div><div id="canvas-landscape-right"><div class='text-buttons'><div class="focus-on-child" tabindex="1"><button class="text-button" type="button" id="download-button" tabindex="-1"></button></div></div></div></div></section></main>
